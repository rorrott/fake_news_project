This project focuses on the detection of fake news. The dataset employed for this endeavor is the Fake News Challenge (FNC-1), which was obtained from Kaggle. The FNC-1 dataset comprises pairs of news articles, often in the form of headlines, along with their corresponding claims. These pairs are associated with stance labels, which include 'unrelated', 'agree', 'disagree', and 'discuss'.
